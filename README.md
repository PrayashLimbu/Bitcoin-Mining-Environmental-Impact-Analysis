Abstract
This research employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the interconnectedness between Bitcoin mining, COâ‚‚ emissions, and global temperature anomalies. The study reveals a concerning positive relationship between Bitcoin emissions and global temperature change, highlighting Bitcoin's potential contribution to climate change.

Key Findings
Environmental Impact Scale
Energy Consumption: Bitcoin mining consumes energy comparable to entire countries like Austria, Netherlands, or Spain
Carbon Footprint: In 2020-2021, Bitcoin network consumed 173.42 TWh, equivalent to 85.89 million tonnes of COâ‚‚
Water Footprint: Estimated at 1.65 cubic kilometers during the same period
Land Footprint: Approximately 1,870 square kilometers

Temporal Analysis
The dataset reveals dramatic growth in Bitcoin's environmental impact:

Early Period (2010-2011):
Maximum emissions: ~94.4 million kgCOâ‚‚ annually
Energy consumption: ~148 million kWh annually

Peak Growth (2016):
Maximum emissions: ~12 billion kgCOâ‚‚ annually
Energy consumption: ~12 billion kWh annually

This represents a 12,600% increase in both energy consumption and emissions over 6 years.

Methodology
Data Processing Pipeline
Temporal Aggregation: Daily data converted to monthly chunks for analysis.

Unit Conversion:

Carbon emissions converted from kg to metric tons (1 Mt = 1000 kg)
COâ‚‚ measurements expressed in parts per million (ppm)
Conversion factor: 1 ppm = 2,129.7 metric tons of COâ‚‚

Temperature Impact Calculation:
Used UCAR Climate Sensitivity Calculator
Estimated temperature increases linked to COâ‚‚ emissions
Integration with NOAA temperature anomaly data

Statistical Analysis
Method: Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using R's Lavaan package
Time Frame: 2011-2021 analysis period

Research Implications
Environmental Urgency
The analysis reveals Bitcoin mining as a significant contributor to climate change, with emissions comparable to those of major industrial nations. The exponential growth trajectory suggests urgent need for sustainable mining practices.
